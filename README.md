# Secret-Santa
This was a very simple Secret Santa program I made so that we can randomly receive someone virtually via a `.txt` document.

### How this works:
When you run the program, if there are no names in the list of names then the program will prompt you to enter names of people partaking. 
If you want to predefine the list of names beforehand you can add the names as strings in the `NAMES` list.

Once the program finishes running then you can find all the `.txt` files in the `assignments` folder.
